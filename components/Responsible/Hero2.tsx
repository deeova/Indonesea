            A grim future looms for the world's coral reefs. Scientists warn that between 70% and 90% of these vibrant underwater ecosystems could vanish within the next 20 years due to a triple threat: warming ocean waters, rising acidity, and rampant pollution.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base text-center lg:text-justify">
            The damage is already evident.Â A 2008 study found that 19% of coral reefs have already disappeared, and only 46% remain in good health. Alarmingly, 60% face potential destruction from human activities, with Southeast Asia bearing the brunt, with 80% of its reefs in jeopardy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-base text-center lg:text-justify">
            This alarming trend is expected to accelerate. By the 2030s, a staggering 90% of all reefs could be at risk, and by 2050, the threat could become all-encompassing, leaving no reef unscathed.
