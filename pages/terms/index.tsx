            <strong>Terms and conditions</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            These terms and conditions (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) set forth the
            general terms and conditions of your use of the indonesea.com
            website (&ldquo;Website&rdquo; or &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) and any of
            its related products and services (collectively,
            &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). This Agreement is legally binding between
            you (&ldquo;User&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo;)
            and Indonesea (&ldquo;Indonesea&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). If you are entering into
            this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you
            represent that you have the authority to bind such an entity to this
            agreement, in which case the terms &ldquo;User&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;you&rdquo; or &ldquo;your&rdquo; shall refer to such entity.
            If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the
            terms of this agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may
            not access and use the Website and Services. By accessing and using
            the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
            understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.
            You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and
            Indonesea, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed
            by you, and it governs your use of the Website and Services.

          <p>
            <strong>Billing and payments</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in accordance with
            the fees, charges, and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or
            charge is due and payable. If, in our judgment, your purchase
            constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require you to provide
            us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo identification,
            and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or
            debit card used for the purchase. We reserve the right to change
            products and product pricing at any time. We also reserve the right
            to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole
            discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per
            household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed
            by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or
            orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the
            event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to
            notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone
            number provided at the time the order was made.

            Indonesea, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
            suppliers or licensors be liable to any person for any indirect,
